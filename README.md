"5507 days ago, on October 31, 2008, the Bitcoin whitepaper was released.  
5507 days later, on November 29, 2023, the Bitcoin Layer 2 solution BEVM unveils its whitepaper!The era of Bitcoin Layer 2 and BEVM has arrived!  
Bitcoin took over a decade to reach a trillion-dollar Market Cap".  
**How long will it take for BEVM to achieve the same milestone?**  
  
BTC commands nearly 50% of the cryptocurrency market share, yet since its inception, Bitcoin has lacked a mature Layer 2 (L2) solution. Following key technological upgrades such as Segwit and Taproot, along with the popularity of the Ordinals protocol and BRC20 tokens, a fully decentralized, EVM-compatible Bitcoin Layer 2 solution, BEVM, has been introduced, using Bitcoin as its gas.

****The Positioning of BEVM****  
BEVM is a decentralized and EVM-compatible Bitcoin Layer2 using BTC as Gas.  
BEVM is based on technologies such as the Schnorr's signature algorithm, brought about by the Taproot upgrade, allowing BTC to cross-chain from Bitcoin mainnet to Layer 2 in a decentralized approach. Since BEVM is compatible with EVM, it allows all DApps which can run in the Ethereum ecosystem to operate on BTC Layer 2, with BTC serving as Gas.  
****The Background of BEVM's Inception****  
1. SegWit and Taproot Upgrades. The birth of BEVM is entirely based on Bitcoin's 2017 SegWit upgrade and the 2021 Taproot upgrade. The SegWit upgrade allowed Bitcoin blocks to accommodate larger data. The Taproot upgrade not only allowed the expanded space to contain more complex data but also introduced the Schnorr's signature algorithm, making decentralized Bitcoin multisig a reality. This, in turn, enabled decentralized Bitcoin cross-chain operations, and ultimately, decentralized BTC Layer2 became a reality. BEVM is the best example of a decentralized BTC Layer2.
The SegWit and Taproot upgrades have once again made Bitcoin great, evolving Bitcoin from the 1.0 era to the Bitcoin 2.0 era, allowing us to see a richer Bitcoin ecosystem.
2. The Explosion of Token Launch Protocols on Bitcoin like Ordinals in 2023
The explosion of Token Launch Protocols on Bitcoin such as Ordinals in 2023 is a result of Bitcoin's SegWit and Taproot upgrades. It has shown the Bitcoin community that issuing assets based on Bitcoin has become possible. Issuing assets is just the first step; a richer and more diverse ecosystem of applications needs to be established on BTC Layer2. Therefore, BEVM was born.
3. Six Years of BTC Layer 2 Exploration by the BEVM Team. The BEVM team has been exploring Bitcoin Layer 2 since 2017. In 2018, the BEVM team's BTC Layer 2, ChainX, achieved 100,000+ BTC cross-chain, but due to industry development, ChainX did not experience a real explosion. In 2021, Bitcoin completed the Taproot upgrade, making real decentralized cross-chain possible for BTC. Therefore, the BEVM team began to build BTC Layer2 based on the Taproot upgrade. In 2023, the explosion of Bitcoin issuance protocols like Ordinals showed the BEVM team that a new era of the Bitcoin ecosystem was coming. Thus, they launched the BEVM pilot network and planned to launch the mainnet in Q1 2024.

   
****The Vision and Market Space of BEVM****

**BTC EVM**  
Building a decentralized  BTC Layer2 that uses BTC as Gas and is compatible with EVM, enabling various applications from the EVM ecosystem to be seamlessly and easily deployed on BEVM, thereby increasing the use and consumption scenarios for Bitcoin. To better maintain the security of the Bitcoin network, BEVM will launch BEVM - Stack in the future, which will help developers and Bitcoin projects with high throughput demands to build their own BTC Layer 2.  
**BTC to EVM**  
BEVM plans to build the DBFX Protocol, a decentralized Bitcoin "foreign exchange system," aimed at introducing Bitcoin(digital gold) into any chain and ecosystem. It aims to help various blockchains and Layer 1 increase their Bitcoin foreign exchange reserves and enhance their monetary credibility. In our view, although WBTC allows Bitcoin to circulate within the EVM ecosystem, it is an asset produced by centralized institutions and contradicts the decentralized philosophy of Bitcoin. By using the DBFX protocol, BEVM enables native BTC to circulate between any chains, allowing users to truly have control over their Bitcoin assets on any chain (being able to freely redeem and generate native Bitcoin on any chain).

## BEVM Whitepaper NFT Launch

5507 days since the Bitcoin whitepaper, BEVM, an EVM-compatible Bitcoin Layer 2 innovation, announced its whitepaper on November 29, 2023. To mark this momentous occasion, BEVM introduced a commemorative collection of 10,000 NFTs on the Bitcoin network. These NFTs, capturing key moments and elements from the Bitcoin ecosystem, serve as mementos to honor the union of traditional Bitcoin technology and modern blockchain advancements.

## NFT Details:
* Quantity: Strictly limited to 10,000 NFTs.
* Availability: Offered on a first-come, first-served basis, with validity ceasing once the limit is reached.
* Activation Block: The distribution starts from Bitcoin block number 819249.
* Value Proposition: The NFTs are solely commemorative, devoid of any intrinsic monetary value.
* Design: The design of each NFT, formatted as an SVG file, reflects the legacy of Bitcoin and the technological evolution embodied by BEVM.

## Participation Process:
1. Downloading the NFT: Users can download the SVG file of the NFT to partake in this historic event.
2. Engraving on Platforms: Enthusiasts have the option to mint or engrave these NFTs on platforms like Unisat, enhancing their digital collections.
3. Commemorative Significance: Owning these NFTs symbolizes a part of Bitcoin's evolving journey, reflecting the integration of new-age blockchain functionalities.

These NFTs, while symbolizing significant milestones, are intended as keepsakes to commemorate the publication of the BEVM whitepaper, reflecting a key development in the history of blockchain technology.
